# airplane seating

Simulation of airplane seating.

## notes

- time to sit = 0
- shuffling assumes no position switching.
- queueing efficiency could be used to compare an airline's boarding strategy (back first, etc) against how much people adhere to it.
- first implementation assumes one side of plane.
- should handle two-sided rows.
- capacity variable - how full is the flight?
